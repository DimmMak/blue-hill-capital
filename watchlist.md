## 🔄 Rules

1. **This list is a candidate pool — nothing on it is a position.**
2. To promote a ticker: `.rumble TICKER` → decide → document trade.
3. To remove a ticker: delete the row. Git history preserves it forever.
4. Refresh snapshot table **weekly at minimum**, always before a rumble on any name.
