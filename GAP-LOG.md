# 🔍 Gap Log — Waypoint Capital

> Every time the system reveals a weak point, log it here within 60 seconds.
> Memory fades. The log is the signal.

**Rule:** write the line immediately. Never batch. Date it. One pattern per line.
**Action threshold:** 3+ gaps in the same area → it becomes a T1 ship.

## 2026-04-18 (Saturday — accuracy obsession day)

- **14:12** · NOW rumble cited 200DMA `$110` · actual `$155.25` · 41% off → shipped **technicals-desk v0.1.0**
- **14:18** · Fundamentals were also stale (P/E cited 49.70, actual 57.88 = 14% off) → confirmed fundamentals-desk catches it
- **14:30** · user caught that price-desk returned regular close but not post-market → shipped **price-desk v0.1.1** (post_market_price + pre_market_price)
- **15:12** · watchlist output had no price column — data/analysis separated wrongly → shipped **.chief watchlist** (chief-of-staff v0.2.0)
- **16:48** · MU forward P/E 4.5 anomaly caught → clarified (cyclical peak trap, not a data bug)
- **17:22** · "Hypotheses stored but nothing scoring them — that's the T1 gap" → shipped **accuracy-tracker v0.1.0**
- **17:45** · "Where is the systematic improvement mechanism?" → shipping GAP-LOG + DAILY-RITUAL now

## 2026-04-17 (Friday — architecture day)

- **12:xx** · First rumble batch anchored on stale web-search prices (NOW $82.91 actual $96.66) → **caught next day by user**, shipped price-desk
- **13:xx** · Every rumble ran single-context = bias contamination → shipped v0.7 subagent isolation
- **14:xx** · Chief of Staff filter could miss signal if miscalibrated → locked in "never-delete" invariant + audit log

## Pattern detection (review weekly)

Gaps are clustering around:
1. **Stale data sources** → web search contamination (mostly fixed via desks)
2. **Missing integrations** → skills can't talk to each other cleanly (work in progress)
3. **No scoring layer** → hypotheses stored but outcomes not tracked (shipped today)
4. **Discoverability** → features exist but user doesn't know how to invoke (menus help)

## How to use this log

```
DAILY:
  - See something weird? Log it here NOW.
  - If it's a real gap, Claude should ship the fix same-day or tier it.
  - If it's a false alarm, still log it — pattern data matters.

WEEKLY:
  - Review last 7 days of gaps.
  - Count clusters. 3+ in same area = T1 ship.
  - Use as input to WEEKLY-RETRO.md.

ANNUALLY:
  - The log itself becomes a case study.
  - Show a recruiter this file → instant credibility.
