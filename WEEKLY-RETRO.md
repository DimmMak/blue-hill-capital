## 🎯 RETROS LIVE HERE — chronologically (newest at top)

## 2026-W16 (Apr 13 – Apr 19) — Foundation Week

### Activity
- Rumbles run:        6 (TSLA, AMD, MU, CRM, NOW×2, and pending)
- Compares run:       1 (CRM vs NOW)
- Strategy meetings:  1 (AI 12mo)
- Trades placed:      0 (original NOW $75 GTC plan invalidated by stale-price bug)
- Trades closed:      0

### Accuracy
- 5 rumbles scored, 3 non-HOLD (AMD, MU, NOW)
- Hit rate: 3/3 = 100% on 1-day sample (NOISE — need 20+ rumbles)
- Pair: 1/1 HIT (CRM vs NOW — NOW outperformed, matching verdict)

### Gaps caught (from GAP-LOG.md) — 7 total
- Fixed same-day: 6
- Fixed this week: 7/7 (100%)

### Ships this week (13 versions across 11 skills)
- royal-rumble v0.1 → v0.9.3 (architecture + blind subagents + price-desk integration)
- waypoint-capital v0.1.0 → v0.1.2 (fund docs + research discipline)
- journalist v0.1.0 (Marks-style memos)
- chief-of-staff v0.1 → v0.2 (attention filter + first dispatch command)
- price-desk v0.1 → v0.1.2 (live prices + menu + watchlist)
- fundamentals-desk v0.1.0 (live fundamentals)
- technicals-desk v0.1.0 (live technicals — death of web-sourced MAs)
- accuracy-tracker v0.1.0 (hypothesis scoring)

### Weak points identified
1. **Web-search data contamination** — shipped 3 desks to kill it (prices, fundamentals, technicals)
2. **Hypotheses weren't scored** — fixed with accuracy-tracker
3. **Single-context contamination** — fixed with subagent isolation
4. **Chief was read-only** — added dispatch via .chief watchlist

### Next week priorities
1. Do 3 REAL rumbles with full desks wired in
2. Place a real first trade when thesis is clean
3. Weekly retro becomes routine habit

### The one lesson
**Accuracy obsession beats feature count.** 11 skills shipped because each one closed a real data hole — not because they looked cool.

### Capital discipline check
- Current capital:    $7,000 (unchanged)
- Positions open:     0
- Cash reserve %:     100% (no deploy yet)
- Invalidation hits:  N/A (no positions)
- Rules broken:       none

## 🎭 The retro principle

```
A fund that reviews itself weekly gets 50x better over a year.
A fund that doesn't review — doesn't get better, it drifts.
```

**The retro is the habit. This file is the proof.** 🃏⚔️
